# Lab Report 5 - Putting it All Together

## Part 1 Debugging Scenario

Ed Question:

### What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?

MacOS / VSCode / VSCode Integrated Terminal

### Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.

My script code want to find a file in a speficed path. My file and script are in the same path. 
It should find the file with my script code. However, after I running the script on the terminal, 
it shows that " File not found at path" in the given path. I am not sure why I got this werid behavior. Since I could successfully run the
script code, but the file could not be found even though script and file.txt are in the same path.

### Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.
