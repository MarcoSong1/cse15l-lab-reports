# Lab Report 1: Week 2
This lab is a tutorial about how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6.
## Step 1: Installing Visual Studio Code
Firstly, We need to install the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) in our computer.

After installing the VSCode and open the VSCode, We will see the Welcome Page in VSCode(get started).

It is fine if the welcome page looks a little bit differently due to the differences of systems and settings.

## Step 2: Remotely Connecting
In this section, we will learn about how to login the remote server by our CSE15L Account.

Firstly, We need to know our CSE15L Student account. We can Look up our course-specific account for CSE15L at [CSE 15L Account](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). Here is also a tutorial about how to reset our CSE15L Password provided by the teaching staff in CSE15L:[Reset CSE15L Account Password](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17IDZn8Qq7Q0RkYMxdiIR0o6HJ3B5YqSW/view)
